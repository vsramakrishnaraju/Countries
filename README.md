# Countries

This feature is designed to display a list of various countries in a TableView, with the capability to expand each country to reveal a detailed view. This detailed view is implemented as a nested TableView within the parent TableView cell, providing an intuitive and hierarchical structure for content presentation. The data for both the list of countries and their detailed information are fetched from multiple external sources via network requests.
